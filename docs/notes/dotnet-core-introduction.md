# Introduction to .NET Core
NET Core Framework is a cross platform subset of the .NET Framework. It ships with a new
runtime known as Core CLR that supports IL compilation and garbage collection, but which
does not support app domains. The class libraries are contained in fine grained packages. At
present the .NET Core Framework can only be used for creating ASP.NET and console
applications. One major difference between .NET core and .NET Framework is that .NET
Core can be deployed side by side with an application.
